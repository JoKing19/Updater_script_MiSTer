# Updater_script_MiSTer
The script updates all MiSTer cores, including menu.rbf and the main MiSTer Linux executable. Simply put <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiSTer-devel/Updater_script_MiSTer/master/mister_updater.sh">mister_updater.sh</a> in your SD and launch it through SSH. You can edit it (Win users, please use Notepad++) in order to change some self-explanatory variables (paths, deleting old cores, etc.). I take no responsibility for any data loss or anything, if your DE10-Nano catches fire itâ€™s up to you: <b>use the script at your own risk</b>.
