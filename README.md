# Updater script for MiSTer
The script updates all MiSTer cores, including menu.rbf and the main MiSTer Linux executable; it updates scaler filters, GameBoy palettes and scripts; it can (experimental and risky) optionally update the whole Lynux system. Simply put <a href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Updater_script_MiSTer/blob/master/update.sh?raw=true">update.sh</a> (please right click for saving the link) in your SD and launch it through MiSTer main menu OSD (press F12 and then Scripts). You can make an update.ini (same name as the script) file with custom user options, see <a href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Updater_script_MiSTer/blob/master/mister_updater.sh">mister_updater.sh</a> for user options and their explanations. I take no responsibility for any data loss or anything, if your DE10-Nano catches fire itâ€™s up to you: <b>use the script at your own risk</b>.
